Project Structure

This project is organized as follows:

Dataset: Contains the dataset files
DeepLearning: Includes the code for the deep learning model used in the project.
Utils: Includes modules written for each task.
tests: Includes one test file.
**Notebooks: contains the main responses:
Three Jupyter notebooks for result analysis, each accompanied by documented answers and references alongside the code.
ArrhythmiaClassificationDocumentation.ipynb: This notebook was run on Google Colab to achieve faster training. The modules were loaded from Google Drive. To run the codes locally, kindly replace the importing section with the provided code snippet.


Result:

After applying different preprocessing steps, and methods to train efficiently, the model achieved 97% accuracy on the testing set.
